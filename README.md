# tfjs-model-view

__tfjs-model-view__ is a library for _in browser_ visualization of neural network intended for use with TensorFlow.js.

Features:

* Automatically render of the neural net 
* Automatically update weights/biases/values
* Different rendering methods: canvas(default), d3

The library also aims to be flexible and make it easy for you to incorporate.

## Sample rendering output

## Usage

```
const modelView = new ModelView(model, {
  /** supports: canvas, d3 */
  renderer: 'd3',           

  /** node radius if no custom renderer is defined */            
  radius: 10,

  /** distance between nodes */
  nodesPadding: 0,

  /** prints layer names */                            
  printStats: true,

  /** gets d3 svg or canvas ctx to pre render */                   
  prepareRenderContext: context => { ... },

  /** executed when predict is called. gets drawing context and prediction result as parameters */
  onPredict: (context, result) => { ... },

  /** executed during training and predict. used to update a node */
  updateNode: (node, value) => { ... },

  /** executed at initialization for each node. context d3 or canvas context */
  nodeRenderer: context => { ... },
  
  

})
```

## Installation

You can install this using npm with

```
npm install tfjs-model-view
```

or using yarn with

```
yarn add tfjs-model-view
```

## Building from source

To build the library, you need to have node.js installed. We use `yarn`
instead of `npm` but you can use either.

First install dependencies with

```
yarn
```

or

```
npm install
```

You can start the dev environment using

```
yarn dev
```

or

```
npm run dev
```
